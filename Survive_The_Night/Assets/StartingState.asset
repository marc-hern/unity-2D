  storyText: 'Darkness.


    Your head is throbbing.  As your eyes slowly open you find yourself behind the
    wheel of your car.  Your window is shattered and steam coming billowing from underneath
    the hood. On the passenger set you notice a handgun.


    Up ahead on the road a lone person stands solemnly, staring angrily.  He charges
    straight at you.


    What do you do?

    1.  Grab the gun.

    2.  Open the door and run.'
