  storyText: 'You grab the gun as the assailant approaches your car.  He violently
    smashes his fists against the windshield of your car paying no mind to the wounds
    he is inflicting upon himself.


    The glass begins to crack.


    You warn the assailant you will shoot if he does not stop.  He does not.  The
    lunatic begins to tear away the glass.  Just as he is about to grab your neck
    you shoot and dispatch him.


    What do you do?

    1.  Exit the vehicle and survey the area.

    2.  Inspect the other cars for other survivors.'
